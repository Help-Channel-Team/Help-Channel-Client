# Run 'dispycosnode.py' program to start processes to execute computations sent
# by this client, along with this program.

# This example illustrates in-memory processing with 'server_available' to read
# date in to memory by each (remote) server process. Remote tasks ('compute' in
# this case) then process data in memory. This example works with POSIX (Linux,
# OS X etc.) and Windows. Note that, as data is read in to each server process,
# a node may have multiple copies of same data in memory of each process on that
# node, so this approach is not practical / efficient when data is large. See
# 'dispycos_client9_node.py' which uses 'node_available' and 'node_setup' to
# read data in to memory at node (and thus only one copy is in memory).

# In this example different files are sent to remote servers to compute checksum
# of their data (thus there is no duplicate data in servers at a node in this
# case).
